## What are Drupal Modules?

Drupal Modules are packages you can install from the Drupal website. 
They often provide a lot of functionality in the backend and are quite useful. 
Some make existing tasks easier, while others provide entirely new functionality. 
However, there is a right and wrong way to install them. 
Let's see what they are.  

## The Wrong Way  

When I say "Wrong Way", I don't mean that it's a bad convention. 
I simply mean that it's not right for the way most projects are set up here. 
Let's see what I mean by that.  

### Procedure

#### Step 1

Go to the page of the module.  

#### Step 2  

Go to the bottom, where it shows you links for various Drupal versions. 

#### Step 3  

Copy the link to the file that contains the module.  

#### Step 4 

Paste the link in the Drupal Backend. (admin/modules/install)

### Why is it wrong?  

The answer is quite simple. 
The way most projects are setup, they ignore certain folders. 
These folders are ignored for a variety of reasons. 
One of them is for formatting.  

Since we want our code to conform to a certain style, we monitor our files. 
These files are checked to see if they follow a certain style of writing.  

However, code written by third-parties shouldn't really be touched, for integrity's sake. 
When we install modules this way, Drupal installs it where it usually does,
but that directory is not ignored when the project is setup. 
This causes the third-party files to be checked as well,
which can throw a ton of warnings/errors, slowing your progress down by a lot.  

Therefore, we follow the right way.  

## The Right Way  

The Right Way to install Drupal Modules is shown below. After that, I'll tell you why it's right,
but you can probably already guess.  

### Procedure  

#### Step 1

Go to the page of the module.  

#### Step 2  

Go to the bottom, where it shows you links for various Drupal versions. 

#### Step 3  

Click on the title of the block that lists your Drupal Version.  

#### Step 4  

You should be taken to a new page, where a composer command is shown for you.  
Copy that command.  

#### Step 5  

Run that command in your terminal, when in your project.  

#### Step 6  

Wait for it to install. When it's done, run the following: 

```
ddev drush en module_name
```  

where module_name is the name of the module you're installing.  
It should be the same name used when running the composer command to install it.  

### Why is it Right?  

In this case, composer installs it in the right directory,
the directory that is ignored.  
Another advantage is that updating modules gets easier,
since you can update all of them using composer.  

If we had installed it the Wrong Way, we would have to update them in the Drupal Backend,
which could take a while.

Hope this post has saved you some time in debugging those pesky error messages you get
from module files.


Happy Coding ;)
