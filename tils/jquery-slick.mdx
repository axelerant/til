## What is Slick?   

Slick is a JS framework that's used to create Carousels/Sliders. 
While it is really powerful and easy-to-use, the setup in a Drupal/PL environment has some nuances that are easily missed.
This guide aims to make this setup process a little easier, so that you can be up and running with Slick in no time.

## Setup  

Some of you may have tried loading the CSS & JS files in the libraries.yml file,
only to find out that it didn't work as you thought it would.  
I've been there, and that's when I found that the method below works as expected for both Drupal and PL.

### Step 1

Let's say you have a component that uses a slider.  
Place these lines at the top of that component's twig file, but after the ```{{ attach_library() }}``` line if you have any.  

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/slick-carousel@latest/slick/slick.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/slick-carousel@latest/slick/slick-theme.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-migrate-1.2.1.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/slick-carousel@latest/slick/slick.min.js"></script>
```

Note the order here. It's Slick CSS first, then jQuery, then Slick JS files.  
This is important, since Slick uses jQuery and needs it to be loaded first.  

The jQuery versions have been taken from the Slick website.  
You may use later versions, but there could be compatibility issues. Feel free to try :) 

### Step 2

Now we'll need to add Slick Types, so that VS Code can understand what Slick is.  
If you've been getting an annoying red squiggly line under 'slick' in your ts file, this will fix it.  


Run the following line in your terminal:  
```bash
npm install --save @types/slick-carousel
```

If it worked, you should be seeing something like this in your package.json file:  
```json
"dependencies": {
    "@types/slick-carousel": "^1.6.37"
}
```

## Done!  

With that we're done! Your Slick setup should be ready to go.

Happy Sliding ;)
