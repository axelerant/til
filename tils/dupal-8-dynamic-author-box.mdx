1. Create a new Block View to view Users (not Content)
2. Filter Criteria : Remove all and Set Access: unrestricted in Block Settings
3. There is a default sort Criteria item. Remove it since it doesn't matter
4. Add a Relationship: Choose "User: Content authored"
5. Add a Contextual Filter: Chose "Content: ID"
6. In the configuration options for the newly added Content: ID, choose these options:  
   ** WHEN THE FILTER VALUE IS NOT AVAILABLE: **
   Provide default value  
   In the Select box choose Content ID From URL  
   ** WHEN THE FILTER VALUE IS AVAILABLE OR A DEFAULT IS PROVIDED: **
   Specify validation criteria  
   Validator select box: Content  
   Content Types: choose the content types you want the view to work with.  
   Filter Value Format: Node ID  
   Action to take if the filter value does not validate: Hide View.
7. Click apply
8. Add desired fields from User: & save the View
9. Go to Structure -> Block layout and configure the block to show on the types of content (node type) you want it to show on.
